This thesis makes use of a 3D Convolutional Deep Neural Network to classify whether a certain lung region contains an abnormal cell aggregation called nodule. The network is trained on an open dataset containing roughly 1000 patient's full ct lung scan and expert annotations reaching a sensitivity of $83.39\%$. To understand how the network is able to solve this tasks, its activation in the intermitted layers is visualized and used for a guided optimization to the network's structure.
