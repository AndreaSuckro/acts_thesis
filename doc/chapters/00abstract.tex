This thesis makes use of a 3D Convolutional Deep Neural Network to classify whether a certain lung region contains a nodule or not. The network is trained on an open dataset containing roughly 1000 patient's full lung scan. The network is analyzed, its features visualized and compared to already existing solutions.
